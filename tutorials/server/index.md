## Introduction

LightDock is a fully open-source framework for flexible protein-protein, protein-peptide and protein-DNA docking, based on a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm: Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO). The LightDock Server is a fully rewritten version of the LightDock framework into the Rust programming language for optimal speed and performance. 

Here, we will show the general features of the service and will provide an step-by-step guide on how to submit and analyze a docking run. For more details, please check the [examples] (https://server2.lightdock.org/examples), [the LightDock Server publication] *(In preparation)* and our list of dedicated [tutorials] (https://lightdock.org/tutorials).
