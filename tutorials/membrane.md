<center><h1>Membrane-associated protein docking</h1></center><br>

This is a complete example of the LightDock docking protocol to model the [2HDI](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2hdi) membrane-associated protein system with the use of an **implicit membrane representation** provided by the [MemProtMD](http://memprotmd.bioch.ox.ac.uk/) database.

**IMPORTANT** Please, make sure that you have the <code>python3</code> version of LightDock installed (<code>pip3 install lightdock</code>). We advise you to follow the basic tutorial about how to run a quick [LightDock simulation](https://lightdock.org/tutorials/2UUY)
