**Tutorials here presented are valid for versions of LightDock <0.9.0. Tutorials for version 0.9.0 coming soon!** 

- [LightDock basics](/tutorials/basics)

Here you can learn the basic principles of LightDock framework,
as well as important details that can help you on your modeling.

- [Simple protein-protein docking example](/tutorials/2UUY)

A quick guide about how to setup a protein docking simulation with LightDock.

- [Complex protein-protein docking with restraints](/tutorials/4G6M)

The use of information to drive the modeling has been extensively demonstrated
to increase the success of your simulation.

It is now possible to include data in the form of **residue restraints** during
the optimisation protocol of LightDock.

- [Protein-DNA docking example](/tutorials/1AZP)

A quick guide about how to setup a protein-DNA docking simulation with LightDock.
We also demonstrate the use of information for modeling protein-DNA interactions.

- [Membrane-associated protein docking](/tutorials/membrane)

A protocol to model membrane-associated protein complexes, making use of an implicit representation of the membrane.

- [Accelerating simulations with the LightDock-Rust implementation](/tutorials/lightdock-rust)

A guide about how to compile and setup the new Rust implementation of LightDock which is way faster than the Python version and with a very scarce memory footprint.

- [Frequently Asked Questions](/tutorials/faq)
