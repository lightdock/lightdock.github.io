<center><h1>LightDock tutorials</h1></center><br>

- [LightDock basics](/tutorials/basics)

Here you can learn the basic principles of LightDock framework,
as well as important details that can help you on your modeling.

- [Simple protein-protein docking example](/tutorials/2UUY)

A quick guide about how to setup a protein docking simulation with LightDock.

- [Complex protein-protein docking with restraints](/tutorials/4G6M)

The use of information to drive the modeling has been extensively demonstrated
to increase the success of your simulation.

It is now possible to include data in the form of **residue restraints** during
the optimisation protocol of LightDock.

- [Protein-DNA docking example](/tutorials/1AZP)

A quick guide about how to setup a protein-DNA docking simulation with LightDock.
We also demonstrate the use of information for modeling protein-DNA interactions.

- Transmembrane docking (work in progress)

We are currently working on the development of a protocol to model membrane-associated
protein complexes, making use of an implicit representation of the membrane.
