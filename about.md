title: About LightDock
---

LightDock is a protein-protein, protein-peptide and protein-DNA docking framework based on the [Glowworm Swarm Optimization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11721-008-0021-5) (GSO) algorithm.

**The framework is written in the Python programming language (version 2.7) and allows the users to incorporate their own scoring function.**

The LightDock framework is highly versatile, with many options that can be further developed and optimized by the users:

* Accepts any user-defined scoring function.
* Backbone flexibility can enabled/disabled for receptor and ligand molecules in an independent way.
* Can use local gradient-free minimization.
* The simulation can be restrained from the beginning to focus on user-assigned interacting regions, for example, transmembrane domains or highly-variable loops in antibody-antigen systems.
* **Residue restraints in both receptor and ligand partners**.
* Support for the use of pre-calculated conformers for both receptor and ligand.
